mqtt_bridge
===========

A MQTT client which receives data via a serial port from a arduino and resend to a Mosca server.
It was originally planned to run on a WRT54GL running openwrt.

This is part of a IoT project which uses Nodejs, Mosca and Node-RED. The other parts I plan to release soon as it reaches a certain maturity.
